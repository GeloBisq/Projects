# ICPC Research

## Overview
ICPC Research is a collaborative collection of algorithmic problem solutions developed during summer research at Riverside City College. The project focuses on strengthening competitive programming skills through systematic practice and analysis of ICPC-style problems.

The work emphasizes building efficient, well-structured solutions while reinforcing core data structures and algorithms.

## Features
- Solutions to multiple ICPC-style problems
- Well-documented implementations
- Focus on efficiency and correctness
- Collaborative code contributions

## Technologies Used
- C++

## Concepts Applied
- Data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, maps, sets)
- Algorithms (searching, sorting, greedy, dynamic programming, graphs)
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Team-based problem solving

## What I Learned
- Approaching unfamiliar problems methodically
- Translating problem statements into algorithms
- Writing efficient contest-style code
- Collaborating on algorithm design

## Future Improvements
