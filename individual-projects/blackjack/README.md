# Blackjack Game Simulation

## Overview
A command-line Blackjack (21) game developed in C++ that simulates a simplified casino-style Blackjack experience. The project focuses on implementing core gameplay mechanics while applying object-oriented programming principles and clean code structure.

This project was developed as part of coursework at Riverside City College and is being iteratively improved.

## Features
- Command-line interface gameplay
- Standard Blackjack rules (simplified)
- Card and deck management system
- Player betting system
- Win, lose, and tie scenarios
- Object-oriented class design

## Technologies Used
- C++

## Concepts Applied
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Dynamic memory management
- Encapsulation
- Game state logic

## What I Learned
- Designing modular class structures for games
- Managing interactions between multiple objects
- Applying inheritance and polymorphism in practice
- Handling memory safely and efficiently in C++
- Structuring a medium-sized C++ project

## Future Improvements
- Add support for multiple players
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Improve input validation and error handling
- Add saving/loading player balance
- Expand to full casino rule variations
